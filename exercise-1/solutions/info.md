This solution demonstrates the basic `ROS` concepts of publisher and subscriber and we are providing solution to you with both `ROS1` and `ROS2` implementations.

While we'll be using `ROS1` in this course since it's what our Duckiebots use, I'm including the `ROS2` solution to show you where robotics is headed. The code may look similar at first glance, with just a few syntax changes (like rospy vs rclpy, different node initialization), but `ROS2` brings major architectural improvements under the hood. It eliminates the need for a central `ROS` master (roscore), uses DDS for communication, and provides better security and real-time features. Think of `ROS1` as our practical foundation â€“ it's stable, well-documented, and still widely used in industry. `ROS2` is the future, built to address `ROS1's` limitations in areas like security, real-time performance, and multi-robot systems. 

Learning `ROS1` now will give you the core concepts that transfer directly to `ROS2`, preparing you for both current and future robotics work. Focus on understanding these fundamentals, and you'll be well-equipped for wherever robotics takes you!

Cheers!
